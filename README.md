# MScthesis: Eight weeks of endurance training increases calcium release and uptake from skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum in sedentary adults

This repository contains data, code and additional files needed to reproduce the master thesis presented in the manuscript titled "Eight weeks of endurance training increases calcium release and uptake from skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum in sedentary adults".

## Repository strucure

Scripts are stored in the `./R` folder. `./data` contains all raw data with processed data (model outputs, summaries etc.) stored in `/data/derivedData`. `./resources` contains files used to produce outputs from R quarto files. All code creating figures (1-6) are located in the `./figures` folder together with resulting pdf-files.

In addition, the files compiles the manuscript:

* `index.qmd`
* `00-abstract.qmd`
* `01-theory.qmd`
