	abstract = {Repeated, intense use of muscles leads to a decline in performance known as muscle fatigue. Many muscle properties change during fatigue including the action potential, extracellular and intracellular ions, and many intracellular metabolites. A range of mechanisms have been identified that contribute to the decline of performance. The traditional explanation, accumulation of intracellular lactate and hydrogen ions causing impaired function of the contractile proteins, is probably of limited importance in mammals. Alternative explanations that will be considered are the effects of ionic changes on the action potential, failure of SR Ca

Many different activities lead to fatigue, and an important challenge is to identify the various mechanisms that contribute under different circumstances. Most of the mechanistic studies of fatigue are on isolated animal tissues, and another major challenge is to use the knowledge generated in these studies to identify the mechanisms of fatigue in intact animals and particularly in human diseases.},

	abstract = {Experiments are described which suggest that the loss of force generating capacity seen during fatigue from intermittent, submaximal voluntary contractions of the quadriceps muscle cannot be explained by any of the usual factors thought to be responsible for fatigue. During the first 30 min of intermittent contractions at 30\% MVC the force generated periodically by a brief test train of 50 Hz stimulation and by brief maximal voluntary contractions both declined by 50\%. Yet no significant changes were seen in the muscle lactate, ATP or phosphocreatine. Glycogen depletion was confined only to the type I and type IIA fibres, with less than 10\% totally depleted. The depletion patterns indicated that the type IIAB and type IIB motor units were not recruited during the first 30 min. The central nervous system appeared to remain capable of generating full muscle activation since the force from maximal voluntary efforts declined in parallel with that from 50 Hz stimulation. We suggest that, in this type of fatigue, the loss of force may be largely due to impaired excitation/contraction coupling. This possibility is supported by the disproportionate depression of the twitches recorded between contractions compared with that from 50 Hz stimulation (low frequency fatigue). The single unit EMG recordings suggest that, in sustained and repeated submaximal contractions, muscle contractile failure is compensated by recruitment of additional motor units rather than by rate coding of those already active. During intermittent contractions large increases in the surface EMG were associated with only modest increases in firing rates. In sustained contractions when the EMG was held constant the discharge rates declined in parallel with the force. In constant force contractions involving about 35\% muscle contractile failure no changes in discharge rates were seen despite substantial increases in EMG.},

                    Excitation–contraction coupling is broadly defined as the process linking the action potential to contraction in striated muscle or, more narrowly, as the process coupling surface membrane depolarization to Ca

                    release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
                  
                
                
                  We now know that excitation–contraction coupling depends on a macromolecular protein complex or ‘calcium release unit’. The complex extends the extracellular space within the transverse tubule invaginations of the surface membrane, across the transverse tubule membrane into the cytoplasm and then across the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane and into the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
                
                
                  
                    The central element of the macromolecular complex is the ryanodine receptor calcium release channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. The ryanodine receptor has recruited a surface membrane L‐type calcium channel as a ‘voltage sensor’ to detect the action potential and the calcium‐binding protein calsequestrin to detect in the environment within the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Consequently, the calcium release channel is able to respond to surface depolarization in a manner that depends on the Ca
                    2+
                    load within the calcium store.
                  
                
                
                  
                    The molecular components of the ‘calcium release unit’ are the same in skeletal and cardiac muscle. However, the mechanism of excitation–contraction coupling is different. The signal from the voltage sensor to ryanodine receptor is chemical in the heart, depending on an influx of external Ca
                    2+
                    through the surface calcium channel. In contrast, conformational coupling links the voltage sensor and the ryanodine receptor in skeletal muscle.
                  
                
                
                  Our current understanding of this amazingly efficient molecular signal transduction machine has evolved over the past 50 years. None of the proteins had been identified in the 1950s; indeed, there was debate about whether the molecules involved were, in fact, protein. Nevertheless, a multitude of questions about the molecular interactions and structures of the proteins and their interaction sites remain to be answered and provide a challenge for the next 50 years.},

              Abstract
              
                Skeletal muscle glycogen is heterogeneously distributed in three separated compartments (intramyofibrillar, intermyofibrillar and subsarcolemmal). Although only constituting 3–13\% of the total glycogen volume, the availability of intramyofibrillar glycogen is of particular importance to muscle function. The present study aimed to investigate the depletion of these three subcellular glycogen compartments during repeated supramaximal exercise in elite athletes. Ten elite cross‐country skiers (aged 25 ± 4 years,

                ; mean ± SD) performed four ∼4 min supramaximal sprint time trials (STT 1–4) with 45 min of recovery. The subcellular glycogen volumes in musculus triceps brachii were quantified from electron microscopy images before and after both STT 1 and 4. During STT 1, the depletion of intramyofibrillar glycogen was higher in type 1 fibres [−52\%; (−89:−15\%)] than type 2 fibres [−15\% (−52:22\%)] (
                P
                 = 0.02), whereas the depletion of intermyofibrillar glycogen [main effect: −19\% (−33:0\%),
                P
                 = 0.006] and subsarcolemmal glycogen [main effect: −35\% (−66:0\%),
                P
                 = 0.03] was similar between fibre types. By contrast, only intermyofibrillar glycogen volume was significantly reduced during STT 4, in both fibre types [main effect: −31\% (−50:−11\%),
                P
                 = 0.002]. Furthermore, for each of the subcellular compartments, the depletion of glycogen during STT 1 was associated with the volumes of glycogen before STT 1. In conclusion, the depletion of spatially distinct glycogen compartments differs during supramaximal exercise. Furthermore, the depletion changes with repeated exercise and is fibre type‐dependent.

                  Glycogen is stored in local spatially distinct compartments within skeletal muscle fibres and is the main energy source during supramaximal exercise.
                
                
                  Using quantitative electron microscopy, we show that supramaximal exercise induces a differential depletion of glycogen from these compartments and also demonstrate how this varies with fibre types.
                
                
                  Repeated exercise alters this compartmentalized glycogen depletion.
                
                
                  The results obtained in the present study help us understand the muscle metabolic dynamics of whole body repeated supramaximal exercise, and suggest that the muscle has a compartmentalized local adaptation to repeated exercise, which affects glycogen depletion.},

              Abstract
              
                Resistance‐exercise volume is a determinant of training outcomes. However not all individuals respond in a dose‐dependent fashion. In this study, 34 healthy individuals (males
                n

                n
                 = 18, 22.0 (1.3) years) performed moderate‐ (3 sets per exercise, MOD) and low‐volume (1 set, LOW) resistance training in a contralateral fashion for 12 weeks (2–3 sessions per week). Muscle cross‐sectional area (CSA) and strength were assessed at Weeks 0 and 12, along with biopsy sampling (m. vastus lateralis). Muscle biopsies were also sampled before and 1 h after the fifth session (Week 2). MOD resulted in larger increases in muscle CSA (5.2 (3.8)\%
                versus
                3.7 (3.7)\%,

                P
                 {\textless} 0.05. This coincided with greater reductions in type IIX fibres from Week 0 to Week 12 (MOD, −4.6 percentage points; LOW −3.2 percentage points), greater phosphorylation of S6‐kinase 1 (p85 S6K1
                Thr412
                , 19\%; p70 S6K1

                , 58\%) and ribosomal protein S6
                Ser235/236
                (37\%), greater rested‐state total RNA (8.8\%) and greater exercise‐induced c‐Myc mRNA expression (25\%; Week 2, all
                P
                 {\textless} 0.05). Thirteen and sixteen participants, respectively, displayed clear benefits in response to MOD on muscle hypertrophy and strength. Benefits were associated with greater accumulation of total RNA at Week 2 in the MOD leg, with every 1\% difference increasing the odds of MOD benefit by 7.0\% (
                P
                 = 0.005) and 9.8\% (
                P
                 = 0.002). In conclusion, MOD led to greater functional and biological adaptations than LOW. Associations between dose‐dependent total RNA accumulation and increases in muscle mass and strength point to ribosome biogenesis as a determinant of dose‐dependent training responses.

              Abstract
              
                One in five adults following physical activity guidelines are reported to not demonstrate any improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). Herein, we sought to establish whether CRF non‐response to exercise training is dose‐dependent, using a between‐ and within‐subject study design. Seventy‐eight healthy adults were divided into five groups (1–5) respectively comprising one, two, three, four and five 60 min exercise sessions per week but otherwise following an identical 6‐week endurance training (ET) programme. Non‐response was defined as any change in CRF, determined by maximal incremental exercise power output (
                W
                max
                ), within the typical error of measurement (±3.96\%). Participants classified as non‐responders after the ET intervention completed a successive 6‐week ET period including two additional exercise sessions per week. Maximal oxygen consumption (
                
                ), haematology and muscle biopsies were assessed prior to and after each ET period. After the first ET period,
                W
                max
                increased (
                P 
                {\textless} 0.05) in groups 2, 3, 4 and 5, but not 1. In groups 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, 69\%, 40\%, 29\%, 0\% and 0\% of individuals, respectively, were non‐responders. After the second ET period, non‐response was eliminated in all individuals. The change in
                
                with exercise training independently determined
                W
                max
                response (partial correlation coefficient,
                r
                partial
                 ≥ 0.74,
                P
                 {\textless} 0.001). In turn, total haemoglobin mass was the strongest independent determinant of
                
                (
                r

                P {\textless} 
                0.001). In conclusion, individual CRF non‐response to exercise training is abolished by increasing the dose of exercise and primarily a function of haematological adaptations in oxygen‐carrying capacity.

Resting muscle antioxidant activities [superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GR), and manganese SOD] were significantly higher in jump-trained compared with untrained subjects. Blood antioxidant enzyme activities and muscle catalase, however, were not different between the two groups. Creatine kinase activities increased significantly (P {\textless} 0.0001) after the jump test in untrained individuals, but remained unchanged in the jump trained. Plasma and muscle malonaldehyde (MDA) after the jump test were not significantly different from rest. These data suggest that jump training is associated with elevated activities of SOD and the coupled enzymes GPX and GR in muscle tissue, but other antioxidants remain unchanged. High-intensity jump exercise induces muscle enzyme leakage in untrained humans, but muscle lipid peroxidation, measured as changes in MDA, was not different in the two groups despite the varied muscle antioxidant enzyme levels.},

              Abstract 
              Little is known about the precise mechanism that relates skeletal muscle glycogen to muscle fatigue. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of glycogen on sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) function in the arm and leg muscles of elite cross‐country skiers (
              n

              ) before, immediately after, and 4 h and 22 h after a fatiguing 1 h ski race. During the first 4 h recovery, skiers received either water or carbohydrate (CHO) and thereafter all received CHO‐enriched food. Immediately after the race, arm glycogen was reduced to 31 ± 4\% and SR Ca
              2+
              release rate decreased to 85 ± 2\% of initial levels. Glycogen noticeably recovered after 4 h recovery with CHO (59 ± 5\% initial) and the SR Ca
              2+
              release rate returned to pre‐exercise levels. However, in the absence of CHO during the first 4 h recovery, glycogen and the SR Ca
              2+
              release rate remained unchanged (29 ± 2\% and 77 ± 8\%, respectively), with both parameters becoming normal after the remaining 18 h recovery with CHO. Leg muscle glycogen decreased to a lesser extent (71 ± 10\% initial), with no effects on the SR Ca
              2+
              release rate. Interestingly, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed that the specific pool of intramyofibrillar glycogen, representing 10–15\% of total glycogen, was highly significantly correlated with the SR Ca
              2+
              release rate. These observations strongly indicate that low glycogen and especially intramyofibrillar glycogen, as suggested by TEM, modulate the SR Ca
              2+
              release rate in highly trained subjects. Thus, low glycogen during exercise may contribute to fatigue by causing a decreased SR Ca

	abstract = {The control of glycolysis in contracting muscle is not fully understood. The aim of the present study was to examine whether activation of glycolysis is mediated by factors related to the energy state or by a direct effect of Ca2+ on the regulating enzymes. Extensor digitorum longus muscles from rat were isolated, treated with cyanide to inhibit aerobic ATP production and stimulated (0.2 s trains every 4 s) until force was reduced to 70\% of initial force (control muscle, referred to as Con). Muscles treated with BTS (N-benzyl-p-toluene sulfonamide), an inhibitor of cross-bridge cycling without affecting Ca2+ transients, were stimulated for an equal time period as Con. Energy utilization by the contractile apparatus (estimated from the observed relation between ATP utilization and force–time integral) was 60\% of total. In BTS, the force–time integral and ATP utilization were only 38 and 58\% of those in Con respectively. Glycolytic rate in BTS was only 51\% of that in Con but the relative contribution of ATP derived from PCr (phosphocreatine) and glycolysis and the relation between muscle contents of PCr and Lac (lactate) were not different. Prolonged cyanide incubation of quiescent muscle (low Ca2+) did not change the relation between PCr and Lac. The reduced glycolytic rate in BTS despite maintained Ca2+ transients, and the unchanged PCr/Lac relation in the absence of Ca2+ transients, demonstrates that Ca2+ is not the main trigger of glycogenolysis. Instead the preserved relative contribution of energy delivered from PCr and glycolysis during both conditions suggests that the glycolytic rate is controlled by factors related to energy state.},

Transmission electron microscopy imaging has revealed the existence of a heterogenic subcellular distribution of three distinct glycogen pools in skeletal muscle, which are thought to reflect the requirements for local energy stores at the subcellular level. Here, we show that the three main energy-consuming ATPases in skeletal muscles (Ca2+, Na+,K+, and myosin ATPases) utilize different local pools of glycogen. These results clearly demonstrate compartmentalized glycogen metabolism and emphasize that spatially distinct pools of glycogen particles act as energy substrate for separated energy requiring processes, suggesting a new model for understanding glycogen metabolism in working muscles, muscle fatigue, and metabolic disorders. These observations suggest that the distinct glycogen pools can regulate the functional state of mammalian muscle cells and have important implications for the understanding of how the balance between ATP utilization and ATP production is regulated at the cellular level in general and in skeletal muscle fibers in particular.},

	abstract = {Two metabolic features of altitude-adapted humans are the maximal O2 consumption (VO2max) paradox (higher work rates following acclimatization without increases in VO2max) and the lactate paradox (progressive reductions in muscle and blood lactate with exercise at increasing altitude). To assess underlying mechanisms, we studied six Andean Quechua Indians in La Raya, Peru (4,200 m) and at low altitude (less than 700 m) immediately upon arrival in Canada. The experimental strategy compared whole-body performance tests and single (calf) muscle work capacities in the Andeans with those in groups of sedentary, power-trained, and endurance-trained lowlanders. We used 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to monitor noninvasively changes in concentrations of phosphocreatine [( PCr]), [Pi], [ATP], [PCr]/[PCr] + creatine ([Cr]), [Pi]/[PCr] + [Cr], and pH in the gastrocnemius muscle of subjects exercising to fatigue. Our results indicate that the Andeans 1) are phenotypically unique with respect to measures of anaerobic and aerobic work capacity, 2) despite significantly lower anaerobic capacities, are capable of calf muscle work rates equal to those of highly trained power- and endurance-trained athletes, and 3) compared with endurance-trained athletes with significantly higher VO2max values and power-trained athletes with similar VO2max values, display, respectively, similar and reduced perturbation of all parameters related to the phosphorylation potential and to measurements of [Pi], [PCr], [ATP], and muscle pH derivable from nuclear magnetic resonance. Because the lactate paradox may be explained on the basis of tighter ATP demand-supplying coupling, we postulate that a similar mechanism may explain 1) the high calf muscle work capacities in the Andeans relative to measures of whole-body work capacity, 2) the VO2max paradox, and 3) anecdotal reports of exceptional work capacities in indigenous altitude natives.},

Fatiguing stimulation caused 1) proportional decreases of tetanic force and R, suggesting a component of the decreased force during fatigue of whole muscle may be due to insufficient calcium to activate contraction; 2) a progressive slowing of the relaxation of both force and R, suggesting slowed force relaxation may be mediated by slowed calcium removal from the myoplasm; 3) an increase of resting level R, suggesting impaired calcium removal from, or increased leakage to the cytosol; 4) prolongation of the twitch contraction, which was paralleled by changes in R. These findings are consistent with previous single fiber studies and suggest that changes in whole muscle contractility with fatigue may be partially mediated by changes in calcium handling by the cell.},

In this review we outline the ionic and metabolic changes that occur in muscle during prolonged activity and focus on how these changes might lead to reduced force. We discuss two distinct types of fatigue: fatigue due to continuous high-frequency stimulation and fatigue due to repeated tetanic stimulation. The causes of force decline are considered under three categories: 1) reduced Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, 2) reduced myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity, and 3) reduced maximum Ca(2+)-activated tension. Reduced Ca2+ release can be due to impaired action potential propagation in the T tubules, and this is a principal cause of the tension decline with continuous tetanic stimulation. Another type of failing Ca2+ release, which is homogeneous across the fibers, is prominent with repeated tetanic stimulation; the underlying mechanisms of this reduction are not fully understood, although several possibilities emerge. Changes in intracellular metabolites, particularly increased concentration of Pi and reduced pH, lead to reduced Ca2+ sensitivity and reduced maximum tension, which make an important contribution to the force decline, especially with repeated tetanic stimulation.},

Depression of the Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity of the enzyme was evident after greater than or equal to 20 min of exercise in SR isolated from the deep fibers of these muscles. The lowered ATPase activity was followed by a depression in the initial rate of Ca2+ uptake in both muscle homogenates and isolated SR fractions after greater than or equal to 45 min of exercise. Maximum Ca2+ uptake capacity was lower in isolated SR only after exhaustive exercise. Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+-sensitive ATPase activity were not affected at any duration of exercise in SR isolated from superficial fibers of these muscles; however, the Mg2+-dependent ATPase activity was increased after 45 min and exhaustive exercise bouts.

              Progressive resistance exercise training (PRT) is the most effective known intervention for combating aging skeletal muscle atrophy. However, the hypertrophic response to PRT is variable, and this may be due to muscle inflammation susceptibility. Metformin reduces inflammation, so we hypothesized that metformin would augment the muscle response to PRT in healthy women and men aged 65 and older. In a randomized, double‐blind trial, participants received 1,700 mg/day metformin (
              N
               = 46) or placebo (
              N
               = 48) throughout the study, and all subjects performed 14 weeks of supervised PRT. Although responses to PRT varied, placebo gained more lean body mass (
              p
               = .003) and thigh muscle mass (
              p
               {\textless} .001) than metformin. CT scan showed that increases in thigh muscle area (
              p
               = .005) and density (
              p
               = .020) were greater in placebo versus metformin. There was a trend for blunted strength gains in metformin that did not reach statistical significance. Analyses of vastus lateralis muscle biopsies showed that metformin did not affect fiber hypertrophy, or increases in satellite cell or macrophage abundance with PRT. However, placebo had decreased type I fiber percentage while metformin did not (
              p
               = .007). Metformin led to an increase in AMPK signaling, and a trend for blunted increases in mTORC1 signaling in response to PRT. These results underscore the benefits of PRT in older adults, but metformin negatively impacts the hypertrophic response to resistance training in healthy older individuals.

	abstract = {It has long been appreciated that rates of ATP utilization and production need to be extremely closely balanced. To put it in molecular rather than molar terms, in human muscle engaged in a 15-min work protocol, approximately 3.3 x 10(20) ATP/g are used and resynthesized at approximately 100 times the resting cycling rates before fatigue, during which time only a 20–25\% decrease in the ATP pool is sustained. Analysis of how such remarkable regulatory precision is achieved suggests that in resting muscle myosin behaves as a latent catalyst whose full catalytic potential 1) is realized with the arrival of an activator signal (Ca2+) and 2) is tempered with reaction products; such proactive control, initiated at ATP utilization, sets the required flux through ATP-producing pathways. For any given enzyme step in ATP-producing pathways, reaction velocity (v) becomes the independent parameter, with substrate concentration ([S], the dependent parameter) being adjusted accordingly. Because the dynamic range for muscles (change from resting to maximum ATP turnover rates) can exceed 100-fold, in many studies of working muscle the percent change in ATP turnover rate exceeds (sometimes by very large margins) the percent change in [S]. These observations are not easily explained by current metabolic regulation models but are consistent with pathway enzymes behaving as latent catalysts in resting muscle. In this view, the unmasking of such latent catalytic potential is the main explanation for how large changes in v can be achieved with modest (sometimes immeasurable) changes in [S].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

              In skeletal muscle, growth of capillaries is an important adaptation to exercise training that secures adequate diffusion capacity for oxygen and nutrients even at high‐intensity exercise when increases in muscle blood flow are profound. Mechanical forces present during muscle activity, such as shear stress and passive stretch, lead to cellular signaling, enhanced expression of angiogenic factors, and initiation of capillary growth. The most central angiogenic factor in skeletal muscle capillary growth is VEGF. During muscle contraction, VEGF increases in the muscle interstitium, acts on VEGF receptors on the capillary endothelium, and thereby stimulates angiogenic processes. A primary source of muscle interstitial VEGF during exercise is the skeletal muscle fibers which contain large stores of VEGF within vesicles. We propose that, during muscle activity, these VEGF‐containing vesicles are redistributed toward the sarcolemma where the contents are secreted into the extracellular fluid. VEGF
              mRNA
              expression is increased primarily after exercise, which allows for a more rapid replenishment of VEGF stores lost through secretion during exercise. Future studies should focus on elucidating mechanisms and regulation of VEGF secretion.},

A presentation is made of ratio-scaling methods, category methods, especially the Borg Scale for ratings of perceived exertion, and a new method that combines the category method with ratio properties.

Compared to their widely used predecessor, "quin2", the new dyes offer up to 30-fold brighter fluorescence, major changes in wavelength not just intensity upon Ca2+ binding, slightly lower affinities for Ca2+, slightly longer wavelengths of excitation, and considerably improved selectivity for Ca2+ over other divalent cations.

The MHC isoform I IB was undetectable in all but three samples. No changes in the proportions of fibres containing any of the MHC isoforms were observed. Fibres containing only MHC isoform I IB were found in very small numbers (only 11 out of 2171). Before the experimental period, between 6 and 10\% histochemical type IIB fibres were found in both groups. This was identical with the proportion of fibres showing co‐existence of MHC isoforms IIA and IIB, but in contrast to the very few fibres containing only MHC isoform IIB.

              Abstract
              
                Calcium cycling is integral to muscle performance during the rapid muscle contraction and relaxation of high‐intensity exercise. Ca

                handling is altered by diabetes mellitus, but has not previously been investigated in human skeletal muscle. We investigated effects of high‐intensity exercise and sprint training on skeletal muscle Ca

              Methods: 
              Crude muscle homogenates were prepared from adult rat gastrocnemius muscle from two experiments. In one experiment, the muscle was extracted immediately after prolonged treadmill running (RUN), after a 45 min period of reduced exercise intensity (RUN+) following RUN and compared with controls (CON). In the second experiment, muscle was extracted during passive recovery following the same run protocol at 10 min (REC10), 25 min (REC25) and 45 min (REC45) and compared with CON.
            
            
              Results: 
              Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca

	abstract = {Prolonged activation of skeletal muscle leads to a decline of force production known as fatigue. In this review we outline the ionic and metabolic changes that occur in muscle during prolonged activity and focus on how these changes might lead to reduced force. We discuss two distinct types of fatigue: fatigue due to continuous high-frequency stimulation and fatigue due to repeated tetanic stimulation. The causes of force decline are considered under three categories: 1) reduced Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, 2) reduced myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity, and 3) reduced maximum Ca(2+)-activated tension. Reduced Ca2+ release can be due to impaired action potential propagation in the T tubules, and this is a principal cause of the tension decline with continuous tetanic stimulation. Another type of failing Ca2+ release, which is homogeneous across the fibers, is prominent with repeated tetanic stimulation; the underlying mechanisms of this reduction are not fully understood, although several possibilities emerge. Changes in intracellular metabolites, particularly increased concentration of Pi and reduced pH, lead to reduced Ca2+ sensitivity and reduced maximum tension, which make an important contribution to the force decline, especially with repeated tetanic stimulation.},

              handling in young men. Twenty-six men (23 ± 2 yr; means ± SD) were randomized to daily intake of oral salbutamol (16 mg/day; RES+SAL) or placebo (RES) during 11 wk of full-body resistance training 3 times/wk. Mean power output during 10-s maximal cycling increased more ( P = 0.027) in RES+SAL (+12\%) than in RES (+7\%), whereas peak power output increased similarly (RES+SAL: +8\%; RES: +7\%; P = 0.400). Quadriceps dynamic peak torque and maximal voluntary isometric torque increased by 13 and 14\% ( P ≤ 0.001) in RES+SAL and 13 and 13\% ( P ≤ 0.001) in RES, respectively. Myosin heavy-chain (MHC) isoform distribution transitioned from MHCI and MHCIIx toward MHCIIa in RES+SAL ( P = 0.002), but not in RES ( P = 0.323). MHCIIa cross-sectional-area increased more ( P = 0.040) in RES+SAL (+35\%) than RES (+21\%). Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca
              2+
              release rate increased in both groups (RES+SAL: +9\%, P = 0.048; RES: +13\%, P = 0.008), whereas Ca

              -uptake rate increased only in RES (+12\%, P = 0.022) but was not different from the nonsignificant change in RES+SAL (+2\%, P = 0.484). Maximal activity of lactate dehydrogenase increased only in RES+SAL (+13\%, P = 0.008). Muscle content of the dihydropyridine receptor, ryanodine receptor 1, and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca
              2+
              -ATPase isoform 1 and 2 did not change with the intervention in either group ( P ≥ 0.100). These observations indicate that the enhancement of sprint mean power output induced by salbutamol is at least partly attributed to greater hypertrophy of MHCIIa fibers and transition toward the MHCIIa isoform.
            
            
              NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Here, we show that daily oral treatment with selective β
              2
              -agonist salbutamol induces muscle fiber isoform transition from myosin-heavy-chain (MHC)-I toward MHCIIa and augments hypertrophy of MHCIIa fibers during a period of resistance training. Compared with placebo, salbutamol enhanced sprint mean power output, whereas peak power output and measures of muscle strength increased similarly during the resistance training period despite augmented hypertrophy with salbutamol. Thus, salbutamol is a muscle anabolic drug that can enhance sprint ability adaptations to resistance training.},

We have examined the effects of changing intracellular metabolites on Ca2+ release, [3H]ryanodine binding, and single-Ca2+ release channel activity of SR isolated from white rabbit skeletal muscle. Increasing Mg2+ (from 0 to 4 mM) and decreasing pH (7.1–6.5) inhibited SR Ca2+ release and [3H]-ryanodine binding. In addition, increasing lactate concentrations from 2 to 20 mM inhibited [3H]ryanodine binding to SR vesicles, inhibited SR Ca2+ release, and decreased the single-channel open probability. These findings suggest that intracellular modifications that disrupt excitation-contraction coupling and decrease Ca2+ transients will promote a decline in tension development and contribute to muscle fatigue. In addition, we show that hydrogen peroxide induces Ca2+ release and increases [3H]ryanodine binding to its receptor, suggesting that reactive oxygen species produced during exercise may compromise muscle function by altering the normal gating of the SR Ca2+ release channel.},

	abstract = {1. The effect of myoplasmic Mg2+ on Ca2+ release was examined in mechanically skinned skeletal muscle fibres, in which the normal voltage‐sensor control of Ca2+ release is preserved. The voltage sensors could be activated by depolarizing the transverse tubular (T‐) system by lowering the [K+] in the bathing solution. 2. Fibres spontaneously contracted when the free [Mg2+] was decreased from 1 to 0.05 mM, with no depolarization or change of total ATP, [Ca2+] or pH (pCa 6.7, 50 microM‐EGTA). After such a ‘low‐Mg2+ response’ the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was depleted of Ca2+ and neither depolarization nor caffeine (2 mM) could induce a response, unless the [Mg2+] was raised and the SR reloaded with Ca2+. Exposure to 0.05 mM‐Mg2+ at low [Ca2+] (2 mM‐free EGTA, pCa greater than 8.7) also induced Ca2+ release and depleted the SR. 3. The response to low [Mg2+] was unaffected by inactivation of the voltage sensors, but was completely blocked by 2 microM‐Ruthenium Red indicating that it involved Ca2+ efflux through the normal Ca2+ release channels. 4. In the absence of ATP (and creatine phosphate), complete removal of Mg2+ (i.e. no added Mg2+ with 1 mM‐EDTA) did not induce Ca2+ release. Depolarization in the absence of Mg2+ and ATP also did not induce Ca2+ release. 5. Depolarization in 10 mM‐Mg2+ (pCa 6.7, 50 microM‐EGTA, 8 mM‐total ATP) did not produce any response. In the presence of 1 mM‐EGTA to chelate most of the released Ca2+, depolarizations in 10 mM‐Mg2+ did not noticeably deplete the SR of Ca2+, whereas a single depolarization in 1 mM‐Mg2+ (and 1 mM‐EGTA) resulted in marked depletion. Depolarization in the presence of D600 and 10 mM‐Mg2+ produced use‐dependent ‘paralysis’, indicating that depolarization in 10 mM‐Mg2+ did indeed activate the voltage sensors. 6. Depolarization in the presence of 10 mM‐Mg2+ and 25 microM‐ryanodine neither interfered with the normal voltage control of Ca2+ release nor caused depletion of the Ca2+ in the SR even after returning to 1 mM‐Mg2+ for 1 min, indicating that few if any of the release channels had been opened by the depolarization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The sarcoplasmic reticulum was loaded with Ca2+ for 5 min at pCa 7.0. The amount of Ca2+ released was derived from the area of the caffeine-induced force response. Ca2+ uptake increased with the MgATP concentration present during loading. It was half maximal at 20 microM and saturated at higher concentrations. The kinetics of Ca2+ release were affected for MgATP concentrations between 0.1 and 0.5 mM or less, but the amount of Ca2+ released by caffeine in ATP-free solutions was substantial. Phosphate (15 mM) only slightly reduced Ca2+ uptake when the loading period was short (1 min). It is unlikely, therefore, that the reduction in MgATP concentration contributes to the depression of Ca2+ released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum during fatigue. The increase in P(i) concentration could play a small role by reducing Ca2+ uptake.},

	abstract = {Intracellular pH (pH,) has been measured before fatiguing stimulation and during recovery in single toe‐muscle fibres of
              Xenopus
              at room temperature. Liquid ion‐sensor microelectrodes were used for pH
              1
              measurements. The pH
              1
              measured before fatiguing stimulation was 6.93 ± 0.11 (mean ± SD,
              n
              = 9) in type 1 fibres and 6.99 ± 0.10 (
              n
              = 4) in type 2 fibres. About 1 min after tension had been suppressed to approximately 40\% of the original by repeated tetanic contractions, pH, was measured again; it was then reduced to 6.34 ± 0.13 (range 6.15‐6.50) and 6.71 ± 0.17 (range 6.50‐6.85) in type 1 and type 2 fibres, respectively. The pH

              recovered at a rate of about 0.05 pH units min
              ‐1
              and was always normalized well before tension. Fibres which exhibited post‐contractile depression (PCD), a delayed force suppression during the recovery period, had similar pH
              1
              normalization rates to those of other fibres. The large variation in pH
              1
              values obtained in fibres fatigued to a standard tension level leads us to conlude that an intracellular acidification is not likely to be the major cause of fatigue produced by intermittent tetanic stimulation. However, an important inhibitory effect in the most acidified fibres, cannot be excluded. Furthermore, we conclude that force recovery in our experiments is controlled by factors other than pH

              , the so‐called ‘lactate threshold’ and efficiency (i.e. the oxygen cost to generate a give running speed or cycling power output) – appear to play key roles in endurance performance.

              to establish the speed or power that can be generated at this oxygen consumption. This review focuses on what is currently known about how these factors interact, their utility as predictors of elite performance, and areas where there is relatively less information to guide current thinking. In this context, definitive ideas about the physiological determinants of running and cycling efficiency is relatively lacking in comparison with
              
              and the lactate threshold, and there is surprisingly limited and clear information about the genetic factors that might pre‐dispose for elite performance. It should also be cautioned that complex motivational and sociological factors also play important roles in who does or does not become a champion and these factors go far beyond simple physiological explanations. Therefore, the performance of elite athletes is likely to defy the types of easy explanations sought by scientific reductionism and remain an important puzzle for those interested in physiological integration well into the future.},

              High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has become popular because it is a time-efficient way to increase endurance. An intriguing and so-far-unanswered question is how a few minutes of HIIT can be that effective. We exposed recreationally active men to one session of three to six sets of 30-s high-intensity cycling exercise. Muscle biopsies taken 24 h later showed an extensive fragmentation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca
              2+
              channels, the ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1). In isolated mouse muscle fibers, this fragmentation was accompanied by increased SR Ca
              2+
              leak, which can trigger mitochondrial biogenesis. The HIIT-induced RyR1 fragmentation did not occur in muscles exposed to antioxidant, which offers an explanation for why antioxidants blunt effects of endurance training.
            
          , 
            
              High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a time-efficient way of improving physical performance in healthy subjects and in patients with common chronic diseases, but less so in elite endurance athletes. The mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of HIIT are uncertain. Here, recreationally active human subjects performed highly demanding HIIT consisting of 30-s bouts of all-out cycling with 4-min rest in between bouts (≤3 min total exercise time). Skeletal muscle biopsies taken 24 h after the HIIT exercise showed an extensive fragmentation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca
              2+
              release channel, the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1). The HIIT exercise also caused a prolonged force depression and triggered major changes in the expression of genes related to endurance exercise. Subsequent experiments on elite endurance athletes performing the same HIIT exercise showed no RyR1 fragmentation or prolonged changes in the expression of endurance-related genes. Finally, mechanistic experiments performed on isolated mouse muscles exposed to HIIT-mimicking stimulation showed reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS)-dependent RyR1 fragmentation, calpain activation, increased SR Ca
              2+
              leak at rest, and depressed force production due to impaired SR Ca
              2+
              release upon stimulation. In conclusion, HIIT exercise induces a ROS-dependent RyR1 fragmentation in muscles of recreationally active subjects, and the resulting changes in muscle fiber Ca
              2+
              -handling trigger muscular adaptations. However, the same HIIT exercise does not cause RyR1 fragmentation in muscles of elite endurance athletes, which may explain why HIIT is less effective in this group.},

A total of 418 biopsies was obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle of 270 healthy sedentary and 148 physically active individuals of both sexes. The lowest and highest proportion of type I muscle fiber observed were 15 and 85\%, respectively. Coefficients of variation (CV) reached approximately 30\% for the proportion of types I and IIA fibers and were two times higher for the proportion of type IIB fiber. The smallest and largest mean muscle fiber cross-sectional areas (CSA) were approximately 1,100 microns 2 and 9,500 microns 2, respectively. Mean CSA of the various fiber types exhibited CV of approximately 23\%. CV reached 30\% for the activity of creatine kinase, ranged between 28 and 41\% for the glycolytic enzyme markers, and between 34 and 44\% for the aerobic-oxidative enzyme markers. The mean proportion of type I fiber was lower in male than in female muscles, whereas the mean CSA of all fiber types was smaller in female than in male muscles. Levels of glycolytic enzyme markers were higher in male than in female skeletal muscles. However, activities of aerobic-oxidative enzyme markers were similar in males and females. These results reveal the existence of large interindividual variability and gender differences in the most common characteristics of the human skeletal muscle.},

              , higher fat oxidation in women cannot be explained by higher AMPK signalling but is accompanied by improved muscle cellular energy balance in women probably due to sex specific muscle morphology.},

              The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) provides feedback control required to balance the processes of calcium storage, release, and reuptake in skeletal muscle. This balance is achieved through the concerted action of three major classes of SR calcium‐regulatory proteins: (1) luminal calcium‐binding proteins (calsequestrin, histidine‐rich calcium‐binding protein, junctate, and sarcalumenin) for calcium storage; (2) SR calcium release channels (type 1 ryanodine receptor or RyR1 and IP
              3
              receptors) for calcium release; and (3) sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca
              2+
              ‐ATPase (SERCA) pumps for calcium reuptake. Proper calcium storage, release, and reuptake are essential for normal skeletal muscle function. We review SR structure and function during normal skeletal muscle activity, the proteins that orchestrate calcium storage, release, and reuptake, and how phenotypically distinct muscle diseases (e.g., malignant hyperthermia, central core disease, and Brody disease) can result from subtle alterations in the activity of several key components of the SR calcium‐regulatory machinery.

The elements constituting the reticulum are disposed in a pattern which bears a constant relation to the bands of the adjacent myofibrils and is therefore repeated in each sarcomere. At the H band the system is transversely continuous but not so at other levels. Longitudinally continuity is interrupted at the Z bands where large vesicles belonging to adjacent sarcomere segments of the system face off on opposite sides of the band. The opposing faces of these vesicles are flat and separated by a space of more or less constant width, in which are located small, finger-shaped vesicles.

	abstract = {Several types of striated muscle have been examined by the technics of electron microscopy and the findings in myotome fibers of Amblystoma larvae, the sartorius, and cardiac muscle of the rat are reported on in some detail. Particular attention has been given to structural components of the interfibrillar sarcoplasm and most especially to a finely divided, vacuolar system known as the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This consists of membrane-limited vesicles, tubules, and cisternae associated in a continuous reticular structure which forms lace-like sleeves around the myofibrils. It shows a definable organization which repeats with each sarcomere of the fiber so that the entire system is segmented in phase with the striations of the associated myofibrils. Details of these repetitive patterns are presented diagrammatically in Text-figs. 1, 2, and 3 on pages 279, 283, and 288 respectively. The system is continuous across the fiber at the H band level and largely discontinuous longitudinally because of interruptions in the structure at the I and Z band levels. The structure of the system relates it to the endoplasmic reticulum of other cell types. The precise morphological relation of the reticulum to the myofibrils, with specializations opposite the different bands, prompts the supposition that the system is functionally important in muscle contraction. In this regard it is proposed that the membrane limiting the system is polarized like the sarcolemma and that the corresponding potential difference is utilized in the intracellular distribution of the excitatory impulse.},

	abstract = {The skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was investigated for the presence of well-known endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers: the lumenal protein BiP and a group of membrane proteins recognized by an antibody raised against ER membrane vesicles. Western blots of SR fractions revealed the presence of BiP in fast- and slow-twitch muscles of the rabbit as well as in rat and chicken muscles. Analyses of purified SR subfractions, together with cryosection immunofluorescence and immunogold labeling, revealed BiP evenly distributed within the longitudinal SR and the terminal cisternae. Within the terminal cisternae BiP appeared not to be mixed with calsequestrin but to be distributed around the aggregates of the latter Ca2+ binding protein. Of the various membrane markers only calnexin (91 kDa) was found to be distributed within both SR subfractions, whereas the other markers (apparent molecular masses of 64 kDa and 58 kDa and a doublet around 28 kDa) were concentrated in the terminal cisternae. These results suggest that the SR is a specialized ER subcompartment in which general markers, such as the ones we have investigated, coexist with the major SR proteins specifically responsible for Ca2+ uptake, storage, and release. The differential distribution of the ER markers reveals new aspects of the SR molecular structure that might be of importance for the functioning of the endomembrane system.},

	abstract = {The mechanism of Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum, which triggers contraction in skeletal muscle, remains the key unresolved problem in excitation-contraction coupling. Recently, we have described the isolation of purified fractions referable to terminal and longitudinal cisternae of sarcoplasmic reticulum. Junctional terminal cisternae are distinct in that they have a low net energized Ca2+ loading, which can be enhanced 5-fold or more by addition of ruthenium red. The loading rate, normalized for calcium pump protein content, then approaches that of longitudinal cisternae of sarcoplasmic reticulum. We now find that the ruthenium red-enhanced Ca2+ loading rate can be blocked by the previous addition of ryanodine. The inhibition constant is in the nanomolar range (20-180 nM). Ryanodine and ruthenium red have no effect on the Ca2+ loading rate of longitudinal cisternae. Direct binding studies with [3H]ryanodine localized the receptors to the terminal cisternae and not to longitudinal cisternae. Scatchard analysis of the binding data gives a dissociation constant for ryanodine in the range of the drug action on the terminal cisternae (approximately 100 nM range) with approximately 4 to 20 pmol bound per mg of protein. Ryanodine is known to be toxic in animals, leading to irreversible muscle contractures. These studies provide evidence on the mode of action of ryanodine and its localization to the terminal cisternae. The low concentration at which the drug is effective appears to account for its toxicity. Ryanodine locks the Ca2+ release channels in the "open state," so that Ca2+ is not reaccumulated and the muscle fiber cannot relax.},

	abstract = {Ryanodine-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ channels (RyRs) open upon binding Ca2+ at cytosolic-facing sites. This results in concerted, self-reinforcing opening of RyRs clustered in specialized regions on the membranes of Ca2+ storage organelles (endoplasmic reticulum and sarcoplasmic reticulum), a process that produces Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). The process is optimized to achieve large but brief and localized increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, a feature now believed to be critical for encoding the multiplicity of signals conveyed by this ion. In this paper, I trace the path of research that led to a consensus on the physiological significance of CICR in skeletal muscle, beginning with its discovery. I focus on the approaches that were developed to quantify the contribution of CICR to the Ca2+ increase that results in contraction, as opposed to the flux activated directly by membrane depolarization (depolarization-induced Ca2+ release [DICR]). Although the emerging consensus is that CICR plays an important role alongside DICR in most taxa, its contribution in most mammalian muscles appears to be limited to embryogenesis. Finally, I survey the relevance of CICR, confirmed or plausible, to pathogenesis as well as the multiple questions about activation of release channels that remain unanswered after 50 years.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY
            1. In humans, the hypertensive effects of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) infusion are reproduced by intravenous or oral Cortisol. Oral Cortisol increases blood pressure in a dose‐dependent fashion. At a dose of 80–200 mg/day, the peak increases in systolic pressure are of the order of 15mmHg. Increases in blood pressure are apparent within 24 h.
            2. Cortisol‐induced hypertension is accompanied by a significant sodium retention and volume expansion. Co‐administration of the type I (mineralocorticoid) receptor antagonist spironolactone does not prevent the onset of cortisol‐induced hypertension. Thus, sodium retention is not the primary mechanism of cortisol‐induced hypertension.
            3. Direct and indirect measures of sympathetic activity are unchanged or suppressed during Cortisol administration, suggesting that cortisol‐induced hypertension is not mediated by increased sympathetic tone.
            4. Preliminary evidence in humans suggests that suppression of the nitric oxide system may play a role in cortisol‐induced hypertension.
            5. These potential mechanisms of Cortisol action may be relevant in a number of clinical contexts, including Cushing's syndrome, apparent mineralocorticoid excess, the hypertension of liquorice abuse and chronic renal failure. There is also preliminary evidence suggesting a role for Cortisol in essential hypertension.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE
              Individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) have a high risk of developing NIDDM. The purpose of this study was to determine whether diet and exercise interventions in those with IGT may delay the development of NIDDM, i.e., reduce the incidence of NIDDM, and thereby reduce the overall incidence of diabetic complications, such as cardiovascular, renal, and retinal disease, and the excess mortality attributable to these complications.
            
            
              RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
              In 1986, 110,660 men and women from 33 health care clinics in the city of Da Qing, China, were screened for IGT and NIDDM. Of these individuals, 577 were classified (using World Health Organization criteria) as having IGT. Subjects were randomized by clinic into a clinical trial, either to a control group or to one of three active treatment groups: diet only, exercise only, or diet plus exercise. Follow-up evaluation examinations were conducted at 2-year intervals over a 6-year period to identify subjects who developed NIDDM. Cox's proportional hazard analysis was used to determine if the incidence of NIDDM varied by treatment assignment.
            
            
              RESULTS
              The cumulative incidence of diabetes at 6 years was 67.7\% (95\% CI, 59.8–75.2) in the control group compared with 43.8\% (95\% CI, 35.5–52.3) in the diet group, 41.1\% (95\% CI, 33.4–49.4) in the exercise group, and 46.0\% (95\% CI, 37.3–54.7) in the diet-plus-exercise group (P \&lt; 0.05). When analyzed by clinic, each of the active intervention groups differed significantly from the control clinics (P \&lt; 0.05). The relative decrease in rate of development of diabetes in the active treatment groups was similar when subjects were stratified as lean or overweight (BMI \&lt; or ≥ 25 kg/m2). In a proportional hazards analysis adjusted for differences in baseline BMI and fasting glucose, the diet, exercise, and diet-plus-exercise interventions were associated with 31\% (P \&lt; 0.03), 46\% (P \&lt; 0.0005), and 42\% (P \&lt; 0.005) reductions in risk of developing diabetes, respectively.
            
            
              CONCLUSIONS
              Diet and/or exercise interventions led to a significant decrease in the incidence of diabetes over a 6-year period among those with IGT.},

                In study 1, six cyclists completed a 3MT immediately after 2 h of heavy-intensity exercise on two occasions to establish the reliability of EP and WEP.

              Results
              
                In study 1, EP (273 ± 52 vs 276 ± 58 W) and WEP (12.4 ± 4.3 vs 12.8 ± 4.3 kJ) after 2 h of heavy-intensity exercise were not different (
                P

                r

                P

              Conclusions
              The EP and WEP may be reliably determined after 2-h heavy-intensity exercise. The 8\% and 20\% reductions in EP and WEP, respectively, have important implications for performance during endurance exercise. The physiological characterization of EP (and, by extension, CP) may differ in a fatigued compared with a rested state.},

	abstract = {We tested the hypotheses that the parameters of the power-duration relationship, estimated as the end-test power (EP) and work done above EP (WEP) during a 3-min all-out exercise test (3MT), would be reduced progressively after 40 min, 80 min, and 2 h of heavy-intensity cycling and that carbohydrate (CHO) ingestion would attenuate the reduction in EP and WEP. Sixteen participants completed a 3MT without prior exercise (control), immediately after 40 min, 80 min, and 2 h of heavy-intensity exercise while consuming a placebo beverage, and also after 2 h of heavy-intensity exercise while consuming a CHO supplement (60 g/h CHO). There was no difference in EP measured without prior exercise (260 ± 37 W) compared with EP after 40 min (268 ± 39 W) or 80 min (260 ± 40 W) of heavy-intensity exercise; however, after 2 h EP was 9\% lower compared with control (236 ± 47 W; P {\textless} 0.05). There was no difference in WEP measured without prior exercise (17.9 ± 3.3 kJ) compared with after 40 min of heavy-intensity exercise (16.1 ± 3.3 kJ), but WEP was lower ( P {\textless} 0.05) than control after 80 min (14.7 ± 2.9 kJ) and 2 h (13.8 ± 2.7 kJ). Compared with placebo, CHO ingestion negated the reduction of EP following 2 h of heavy-intensity exercise (254 ± 49 W) but had no effect on WEP (13.5 ± 3.4 kJ). These results reveal a different time course for the deterioration of EP and WEP during prolonged endurance exercise and indicate that EP is sensitive to CHO availability.
            NEW \& NOTEWORTHY The parameters of the power-duration relationship [critical power (CP) and the curvature constant (W′)] have typically been considered to be static. Here we report the time course for reductions in CP and W′, as estimated with the 3-min all-out cycle test, during 2 h of heavy-intensity exercise. We also show that carbohydrate ingestion during exercise preserves CP, but not W′, without altering muscle glycogen depletion. These results provide new mechanistic and practical insight into the power-duration curve and its relationship to exercise-related fatigue development.},

At periodic intervals of about 300 A, the SR membrane forms small projections, whose tips are joined to the T system membrane by some amorphous material. The SR projections and the amorphous material are here called SR feet. The feet are disposed in two parallel rows, two such rows being present on either side of the T-system tubule.

	abstract = {Measurements of the intracellular free concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) were performed during fatiguing stimulation of intact, single muscle fibers, which were dissected from a mouse foot muscle and loaded with fura-2. Fatigue, which was produced by repeated 100-Hz tetani, generally occurred in three phases. Initially, tension declined rapidly to approximately 90\% of the original tension (0.9 Po) and during this period the tetanic [Ca2+]i increased significantly (phase 1). Then followed a lengthy period of almost stable tension production and tetanic [Ca2+]i (phase 2). Finally, both the tetanic [Ca2+]i and tension fell relatively fast (phase 3). The resting [Ca2+]i rose continuously throughout the stimulation period. A 10-s rest period during phase 3 resulted in a significant increase of both tetanic [Ca2+]i and tension, whereas a 10-s pause during phase 2 did not have any marked effect. Application of caffeine under control conditions and early during phase 2 resulted in a substantial increase of the tetanic [Ca2+]i but no marked tension increase, whereas caffeine applied at the end of fatiguing stimulation (tension depressed to approximately 0.3 Po) gave a marked increase of both tetanic [Ca2+]i and tension. The tetanic [Ca2+]i for a given tension was generally higher during fatiguing stimulation than under control conditions. Fatigue developed more rapidly in fibers exposed to cyanide. In these fibers there was no increase of tetanic [Ca2+]i during phase 1 and the increase of the resting [Ca2+]i during fatiguing stimulation was markedly larger. The present results indicate that fatigue produced by repeated tetani is caused by a combination of reduced maximum tension-generating capacity, reduced myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity, and reduced Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The depression of maximum tension-generating capacity develops early during fatiguing stimulation and it is of greatest importance for the force decline at early stages of fatigue. As fatigue gets more severe, reduced Ca2+ sensitivity and reduced Ca2+ release become quantitatively more important for the tension decline.},

SERCA2a (cardiac/slow-twitch skeletal muscle), SERCA2b (ubiquitous smooth- and non-muscle), and SERCA3 (non-muscle). Each isoform was expressed efficiently and appeared to be targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. All isoforms displayed qualitatively similar enzymatic properties and were activated by calcium in a cooperative manner with a Hill coefficient of 2. The quantitative properties of SERCA1 and SERCA2a (the muscle isoforms) were identical in all respects. SERCA2b, however, appeared to have a lower turnover rate for both calcium transport and ATP hydrolysis. SERCA3 displayed a reduced apparent affinity for calcium, an increased apparent affinity for vanadate, and an altered pH dependence when compared with the other isoforms. These properties are consistent with an enzyme in which the equilibrium between the E1 and E2 conformations is shifted toward the E2 state.},

The Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation at 0 degree C (mean +/- S.E.) was 40.0 +/- 2.5 (n = 6) and 6.2 +/- 0.7 (n = 4) nmol/g wet wt. in rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscle, respectively (P less than 0.001).

After freeze drying of the muscle specimen fragments of single fibres were dissected out and stained for myofibrillar‐ATPase with preincubations at pH's of 10.3, 4.6, and 4.35. Type I (“red”) and II A, B, and C (“white”) fibres could then be identified. Glycogen content was the same in different fibres, whereas triglyceride content was highest in Type I fibres (2–3 × Type II). No significant differences were observed for Na

The subgroups of Type II fibres were distinguished by differences in both SDH and PFK activities (SDH, Type II C {\textgreater} A {\textgreater} B; PFK, Type II B {\textgreater} A ≊ C). It is concluded that contractile and metabolic characteristics of human skeletal fibres are very similar to many other species. One difference, however, appears to be that no Type II fibres have an oxidative potential higher than Type I fibres.},

Mechanically skinned fast‐twitch (FT) and slow‐twitch (ST) muscle fibres of the rat were used to investigate the effects of fatigue‐like changes in creatine phosphate (CP) and inorganic phosphate (P(i)) concentration on Ca(2+)‐activation properties of the myofilaments as well as Ca2+ movements into and out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). 2. Decreasing CP from 50 mM to zero in FT fibres increased maximum Ca(2+)‐activated tension (Tmax) by 16 +/‐ 2\% and shifted the mid‐point of the tension‐pCa relation (pCa50) to the left by 0.28 +/‐ 0.03 pCa units. In ST fibres, a decrease of CP from 25 mM to zero increased Tmax by 9 +/‐ 1\% and increased the pCa50 by 0.16 +/‐ 0.01 pCa units. The effect of CP on Tmax was suppressed in both fibre types by prior treatment with 0.3 mM FDNB (1‐fluoro‐2,4‐dinitrobenzene), suggesting that these effects may occur via changes in creatine kinase activity. 3. Increases of P(i) in the range 0‐50 mM reduced the pCa50 and Tmax in both fibre types. These effects were more pronounced in ST fibres than in FT fibres in absolute terms. However, normalization of the results to resting P(i) levels appropriate to both fibre types (1 mM for FT and 5 mM for ST fibres) revealed similar decreases in Tmax (approximately 39\% at 25 mM P(i) and approximately 48\% at 50 mM P(i)) and pCa50 (0.25 pCa units at 25‐50 mM P(i)). The depressant action of P(i) on both parameters was considerably reduced when the rise in P(i) was accompanied by an equivalent reduction in [CP]. 4. Tension development in the presence of complex, fatigue‐like milieu changes (40 mM P(i) for FT; 20 mM P(i) for ST) was decreased by 35‐40\% at a constant myoplasmic [Ca2+] of 6 microM in both fibre types. 5. SR Ca2+ loading at a myoplasmic [Ca2+] of 100 nM was found to increase abruptly when the [P(i)] during loading was increased to near 9 mM. At a myoplasmic [Ca2+] of 300 nM, the threshold P(i) for this effect dropped to approximately 3 mM. 6. Tension responses evoked by caffeine in the absence of P(i) were smaller and slower to peak if fibres were exposed to P(i) in a restricted myoplasmic Ca2+ pool after SR Ca2+ loading. This indicated that myoplasmic P(i) can decrease and prolong the rate of Ca2+ release from the SR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

              Glucose is stored as glycogen in skeletal muscle. The importance of glycogen as a fuel during exercise has been recognized since the 1960s; however, little is known about the precise mechanism that relates skeletal muscle glycogen to muscle fatigue. We show that low muscle glycogen is associated with an impairment of muscle ability to release Ca

              release inside the muscle. These data provide indications of a signal that links energy utilization, i.e. muscle contraction, with the energy content in the muscle, thereby inhibiting a detrimental depletion of the muscle energy store.

              Abstract 
              Little is known about the precise mechanism that relates skeletal muscle glycogen to muscle fatigue. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of glycogen on sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) function in the arm and leg muscles of elite cross‐country skiers (

              ) before, immediately after, and 4 h and 22 h after a fatiguing 1 h ski race. During the first 4 h recovery, skiers received either water or carbohydrate (CHO) and thereafter all received CHO‐enriched food. Immediately after the race, arm glycogen was reduced to 31 ± 4\% and SR Ca
              2+
              release rate decreased to 85 ± 2\% of initial levels. Glycogen noticeably recovered after 4 h recovery with CHO (59 ± 5\% initial) and the SR Ca
              2+
              release rate returned to pre‐exercise levels. However, in the absence of CHO during the first 4 h recovery, glycogen and the SR Ca
              2+
              release rate remained unchanged (29 ± 2\% and 77 ± 8\%, respectively), with both parameters becoming normal after the remaining 18 h recovery with CHO. Leg muscle glycogen decreased to a lesser extent (71 ± 10\% initial), with no effects on the SR Ca
              2+
              release rate. Interestingly, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed that the specific pool of intramyofibrillar glycogen, representing 10–15\% of total glycogen, was highly significantly correlated with the SR Ca
              2+
              release rate. These observations strongly indicate that low glycogen and especially intramyofibrillar glycogen, as suggested by TEM, modulate the SR Ca
              2+
              release rate in highly trained subjects. Thus, low glycogen during exercise may contribute to fatigue by causing a decreased SR Ca

	abstract = {In this study we investigated the roles of cytoplasmic ATP as both an energy source and a regulatory molecule in various steps of the excitation–contraction (E–C) coupling process in fast‐twitch skeletal muscle fibres of the rat. Using mechanically skinned fibres with functional E–C coupling, it was possible to independently alter cytoplasmic [ATP] and free [Mg
              2+
              ]. Electrical field stimulation was used to elicit action potentials (APs) within the sealed transverse tubular (T‐) system, producing either twitch or tetanic (50 Hz) force responses. Measurements were also made of the amount of Ca
              2+
              released by an AP in different cytoplasmic conditions. The rate of force development and relaxation of the contractile apparatus was measured using rapid step changes in [Ca
              2+
              ]. Twitch force decreased substantially (∼30\%) at 2 m

              ATP compared to the level at 8 m
              m
              ATP, whereas peak tetanic force only declined by ∼10\% at 0.5 m
              m
              ATP. The rate of force development of the twitch and tetanus was slowed only slightly at [ATP]≥ 0.5 m
              m
              , but was slowed greatly ({\textgreater} 6‐fold) at 0.1 m
              m
              ATP, the latter being due primarily to slowing of force development by the contractile apparatus. AP‐induced Ca

              m
              ATP, respectively, and by ∼40\% by raising the [Mg

              2+
              release and twitch responses in a manner consistent with its action as a competitive weak agonist for the ATP regulatory site on the ryanodine receptor (RyR). These findings show that (a) ATP is a limiting factor for normal voltage‐sensor activation of the RyRs, and (b) large reductions in cytoplasmic [ATP], and concomitant elevation of [Mg
              2+
              ], substantially inhibit E–C coupling and possibly contribute to muscle fatigue in fast‐twitch fibres in some circumstances.},

	abstract = {Objective: Sarcopenia, fatigue, and depression are associated with higher mortality rates and adverse outcomes in the aging population. Understanding the association among clinical variables, mainly symptoms, is important for screening and appropriately managing these conditions. The aim of this article is to evaluate the association among sarcopenia and its elements with depression and fatigue. Method: We used cross-sectional data from 2012 SABE ( Salud, Bienestar y Envejecimiento)-Bogotá study, which included 2,000 participants of ages ≥60 years. Sarcopenia and its elements were taken as the dependent variable, while fatigue and depression were the main independent variables. We tested the association among these through multiple logistic regression models, which were fitted for each dependent variable and adjusted for confounding variables. Results: Our findings showed that gait speed was associated with fatigue (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.41, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = [1.05, 1.90], p = .02) as well as abnormal handgrip strength (adjusted OR = 1.40, 95\% CI = [1.02, 1.93], p = .04). No other associations were significant. Conclusion: While sarcopenia and fatigue are not associated, two of the sarcopenia-defining variables are associated with fatigue; this suggests that lack of sarcopenia does not exclude undesirable outcomes related to fatigue in aging adults. Also, the lack of association between sarcopenia-defining elements and depression demonstrates that depression and fatigue are different concepts.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is one of the most prevalent symptoms patients with cancer experience, both during and after treatment. CRF is pervasive and affects patients' quality of life considerably. It is important, therefore, to understand the underlying pathophysiology of CRF in order to develop useful strategies for prevention and treatment. At present, the etiology of CRF is poorly understood and the relative contributions of the neoplastic disease, various forms of cancer therapy, and comorbid conditions (e.g., anemia, cachexia, sleep disorders, depression) remain unclear. In any individual, the etiology of CRF probably involves the dysregulation of several physiological and biochemical systems. Mechanisms proposed as underlying CRF include 5-HT neurotransmitter dysregulation, vagal afferent activation, alterations in muscle and ATP metabolism, hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis dysfunction, circadian rhythm disruption, and cytokine dysregulation. Currently, these hypotheses are largely based on evidence from other conditions in which fatigue is a characteristic, in particular chronic fatigue syndrome and exercise-induced fatigue. The mechanisms that lead to fatigue in these conditions provide a theoretical basis for future research into the complex etiology of this distressing and debilitating symptom. An understanding of relevant mechanisms may offer potential routes for its prevention and treatment in patients with cancer.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Sleep apnea and associated daytime sleepiness and fatigue are common manifestations of mainly obese middle-aged men. The onset of sleep apnea peaks in middle age, and its morbid and mortal sequelae include complications from accidents and cardiovascular events. The pathophysiology of sleep apnea remains obscure. The purpose of this study was to test three separate, albeit closely related, hypotheses. 1) Does sleep apnea contribute to the previously reported changes of plasma cytokine (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6) and leptin levels independently of obesity? 2) Among obese patients, is it generalized or visceral obesity that predisposes to sleep apnea? 3) Is apnea a factor independent from obesity in the development of insulin resistance? Obese middle-aged men with sleep apnea were first compared with nonapneic age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched obese and age-matched lean men. All subjects were monitored in the sleep laboratory for 4 consecutive nights. We obtained simultaneous indexes of sleep, sleep stages, and sleep apnea, including apnea/hypopnea index and percent minimum oxygen saturation. The sleep apneic men had higher plasma concentrations of the adipose tissue-derived hormone, leptin, and of the inflammatory, fatigue-causing, and insulin resistance-producing cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 than nonapneic obese men, who had intermediate values, or lean men, who had the lowest values. Because these findings suggested that sleep apneics might have a higher degree of insulin resistance than the BMI-matched controls, we studied groups of sleep-apneic obese and age- and BMI-matched nonapneic controls in whom we obtained computed tomographic scan measures of total, sc, and visceral abdominal fat, and additional biochemical indexes of insulin resistance, including fasting plasma glucose and insulin. The sleep apnea patients had a significantly greater amount of visceral fat compared to obese controls (\&lt;0.05) and indexes of sleep disordered breathing were positively correlated with visceral fat, but not with BMI or total or sc fat. Furthermore, the biochemical data confirmed a higher degree of insulin resistance in the group of apneics than in BMI-matched nonapneic controls. We conclude that there is a strong independent association among sleep apnea, visceral obesity, insulin resistance and hypercytokinemia, which may contribute to the pathological manifestations and somatic sequelae of this condition.},

	abstract = {Collagenase treatment of skeletal muscle results in the formation of large spheres of membranes (3–30 microns diam). A procedure is described for purification and concentration of these giant membrane vesicles prepared from rat muscle. Morphological observations, marker enzyme analysis, and immunoblotting demonstrate that the vesicles are of plasma membrane origin and that sarcoplasmic reticulum, T-tubules, and mitochondrial inner membranes are absent from the preparation. Western blots demonstrate that the vesicles contain GLUT-4 glucose transporters, whereas GLUT-1 could not be detected. Vesicles prepared from control muscle display specific transport of D-glucose with a maximum velocity (Vmax) for glucose influx of approximately 2,500 pmol.mg plasma membrane protein-1.s-1 and an apparent Michaelis constant (Km) of 16 mM measured at zero-trans conditions at room temperature. Muscle contractions in vivo doubled the Vmax of vesicle glucose transport and membrane GLUT-4 content but did not change Km. In contrast, in vivo administration of insulin did not affect vesicle glucose transport or membrane GLUT-4 content. The combination of insulin and contractions caused similar changes as did contractions alone. It is concluded that the present vesicle population contains membrane components almost exclusively derived from the plasma membrane and contains very little if any GLUT-1 but substantial amounts of GLUT-4. Thus the preparation allows the study of transport kinetics of pure GLUT-4 transporters. The procedure for preparing vesicles probably results in activation of the glucose transport system similar to the activation by insulin but not by contractions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

SERCA2a (cardiac/slow-twitch skeletal muscle), SERCA2b (ubiquitous smooth- and non-muscle), and SERCA3 (non-muscle). Each isoform was expressed efficiently and appeared to be targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. All isoforms displayed qualitatively similar enzymatic properties and were activated by calcium in a cooperative manner with a Hill coefficient of 2. The quantitative properties of SERCA1 and SERCA2a (the muscle isoforms) were identical in all respects. SERCA2b, however, appeared to have a lower turnover rate for both calcium transport and ATP hydrolysis. SERCA3 displayed a reduced apparent affinity for calcium, an increased apparent affinity for vanadate, and an altered pH dependence when compared with the other isoforms. These properties are consistent with an enzyme in which the equilibrium between the E1 and E2 conformations is shifted toward the E2 state.},

	abstract = {The possibility of quantifying the total concentration of Ca2+-dependent Mg2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum was investigated by measurement of the Ca2+-dependent steady-state phosphorylation from [gamma-32P]ATP and the Ca2+-dependent 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphatase (3-O-MFPase) activity in crude muscle homogenates. The Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation at 0 degree C (mean +/- S.E.) was 40.0 +/- 2.5 (n = 6) and 6.2 +/- 0.7 (n = 4) nmol/g wet wt. in rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscle, respectively (P less than 0.001). The Ca2+-dependent 3-O-MFPase activity at 37 degrees C was 1424 +/- 238 (n = 6) and 335 +/- 56 (n = 4) nmol/min per g wet wt. in rat EDL and soleus muscle, respectively (P less than 0.01). The molecular activity calculated from these measurements amounted to 35 +/- 5 min-1 (n = 6) and 55 +/- 10 min-1 (n = 4) for EDL and soleus muscle respectively. These values were not different from the molecular activity calculated for purified Ca2+-ATPase (36 min-1). The Ca2+-dependent 32P incorporation in soleus muscle decreased in the order mice greater than rats greater than guinea pigs. In EDL muscles from hypothyroid rats at a 30\% reduction of the Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation was observed. The Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation in vastus lateralis muscle from three human subjects amounted to 4.5 +/- 0.8 nmol/g wet wt. It is concluded that measurement of the Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation allows rapid and reproducible quantification of the concentration of Ca2+-dependent Mg2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum. Since only 20-60 mg of tissue is required for the measurements, the method can also be used for biopsies obtained in clinical studies.},

A large number of reproducible tetani could be obtained at temperatures less than or equal to 35 degrees C. 2. The tetanic force per cross‐sectional area generated at 25.0 degrees C was 375 +/‐ 56 kPa (mean +/‐ S.D., n = 16). 3. The curve relating maximum tetanic tension to temperature exhibited a transition between a level of almost unaltered force (25.0‐32.5 degrees C) and a marked force decline (less than or equal to 20.0 degrees C). At temperatures higher than 35.0 degrees C force production was markedly depressed and this reduction was in some cases irreversible. 4. Twitch tension showed less regular dependence on temperature; it was reduced less than tetanic tension at low temperatures. Thus, the twitch/tetanus tension ratio was higher at low temperatures. 5. The times for twitch contraction and for twitch half‐relaxation (i) ranged from 7 to 14 ms and from 6 to 15 ms at 35.0 degrees C and (ii) exhibited Q10 values of 3.2 +/‐ 0.4 and 4.0 +/‐ 0.6, respectively. 6. It is concluded that it is possible to use intact, single fibres dissected from mammalian skeletal muscle in physiological studies.

              In this review, we argue that several key features of maximal oxygen uptake (VO

              max) should underpin discussions about the biological and reductionist determinants of its interindividual variability: (i) training‐induced increases in VO
              2
              max are largely facilitated by expansion of red blood cell volume and an associated improvement in stroke volume, which also adapts independent of changes in red blood cell volume. These general concepts are also informed by cross‐sectional studies in athletes that have very high values for VO
              2
              max. Therefore, (ii) variations in VO
              2
              max improvements with exercise training are also likely related to variations in these physiological determinants. (iii) All previously untrained individuals will respond to endurance exercise training in terms of improvements in VO
              2
              max provided the stimulus exceeds a certain volume and/or intensity. Thus, genetic analysis and/or reductionist studies performed to understand or predict such variations might focus specifically on DNA variants or other molecular phenomena of relevance to these physiological pathways.},

In the exercising human, maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O2max) is limited by the ability of the cardiorespiratory system to deliver oxygen to the exercising muscles. This is shown by three major lines of evidence: 1) when oxygen delivery is altered (by blood doping, hypoxia, or beta-blockade), V̇O2max changes accordingly; 2) the increase in V̇O2max with training results primarily from an increase in maximal cardiac output (not an increase in the a-v̄ O2 difference); and 3) when a small muscle mass is overperfused during exercise, it has an extremely high capacity for consuming oxygen. Thus, O2 delivery, not skeletal muscle O2 extraction, is viewed as the primary limiting factor for V̇O2max in exercising humans. Metabolic adaptations in skeletal muscle are, however, critical for improving submaximal endurance performance. Endurance training causes an increase in mitochondrial enzyme activities, which improves performance by enhancing fat oxidation and decreasing lactic acid accumulation at a given V̇O2. V̇O2max is an important variable that sets the upper limit for endurance performance (an athlete cannot operate above 100\% V̇O2max. for extended periods). Running economy and fractional utilization of V̇O2max also affect endurance performance.

              The muscle glycogen content of the quadriceps femoris muscle was determined in 9 healthy subjects with the aid of the needle biopsy technique. The glycogen content could be varied in the individual subjects by instituting different diets after exhaustion of the glycogen store by hard exercise. Thus, the glycogen content after a fat ± protein (P) and a carbohydrate‐rich (C) diet varied maximally from 0.6 g/100g muscle to 4.7 g. In all subjects, the glycogen content after the C diet was higher than the normal range for muscle glycogen, determined after the mixed (M) diet. After each diet period, the subjects worked on a bicycle ergometer at a work load corresponding to 75 per cent of their maximal O
              2
              uptake, to complete exhaustion. The average work time was 59, 126 and 189 min after diets P, M and C, and a good correlation was noted between work time and the initial muscle glycogen content. The total carbohydrate utilization during the work periods (54–798 g) was well correlated to the decrease in glycogen content. It is therefore concluded that the glycogen content of the working muscle is a determinant for the capacity to perform long‐term heavy exercise. Moreover, it has been shown that the glycogen content and, consequently, the long‐term work capacity can be appreciably varied by instituting different diets after glycogen depletion.},

The majority of the calcium required for this process is derived, at least in vertebrate striated muscle fibres, from discrete intracellular stores located at sites within the cell: the terminal cysternae (tc)/junctional SR of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) (Fig. 1 a). These storage sites not only form a compartment that is distinct from the sarcoplasm of the fibre, but they are also closely associated with the contractile elements, the myofibrils. The SR release sites are activated following the spread of electrical activity (Huxley and Taylor, 1958) along the transverse (T) tubular system (Eisenberg and Gage, 1967; Adrian et al. 1969a, b; Peachey, 1973) from the surface membrane (Bm).},

              This is one of the first intervention studies to examine how low- (LIT) and high-intensity endurance training (HIT) affect durability, defined as ‘time of onset and magnitude of deterioration in physiological-profiling characteristics over time during prolonged exercise’.
            
            
              Methods:

              2max
              ): 1) by the magnitude and 2) onset of drifts (i.e. gradual change in energy expenditure, heart rate, rate of perceived exertion, ventilation, left ventricular ejection time, and stroke volume), 3) by the ‘physiological strain’, defined to be the absolute responses of heart rate and its variability, lactate, and rate of perceived exertion.

              Conclusion:
              Durability improved similarly by both LIT and HIT based on reduced physiological drifts, their postponed onsets, and changes in physiological strain. Despite durability enhanced among untrained people, a 10-week intervention did not alter drifts and their onsets in a large amount, even though it attenuated physiological strain.},

	abstract = {1. Single fibres isolated from the anterior tibialis muscle of Rana temporaria (temperature, 2‐5 degrees C; sarcomere length, 2.10 microns) were fatigued using two separate protocols that led to different degrees of depression of tetanic force. Under control conditions the fibre was stimulated to produce a 1 s fused isometric tetanus at 300 s intervals. A moderate degree of fatigue (tetanic force reduced to 70‐80\% of the control value) was produced by decreasing the intervals between tetani to 15 s (‘fatiguing protocol 1’). A more pronounced depression of tetanic force (to 40‐50\% of the control value) was produced by evoking a single twitch at 1‐2 s intervals (‘fatiguing protocol 2’). 2. Fatiguing protocol 1 reduced the contracture response to submaximal and supramaximal concentrations of caffeine (3‐15 mM) in proportion to the decrease in tetanic force. These results support the view that fatiguing stimulation according to protocol 1 leads to a true ‘myofibrillar fatigue’ with no failure of activation of the muscle fibre. 3. Fatiguing protocol 2 reduced the amplitudes of isometric twitch and tetanus to below 10 and 50\% of the control values, respectively. By contrast, the maximal contracture response to caffeine (15 mM) was depressed by merely 2‐3\% of its prefatigue value. 4. Force and instantaneous fibre stiffness were recorded simultaneously during twitch and tetanus as fatigue was induced by protocol 2. During the initial part of fatigue (tetanic force reduced by 25\% of control) stiffness was reduced by merely 9\% in accordance with previous measurements during fatigue induced by protocol 1. However, with further depression of twitch and tetanus by protocol 2 there was a marked reduction of fibre stiffness. These results, together with the findings reported under point 3, strongly suggest that at an advanced state of fatigue induced by protocol 2 the decrease in active force is largely due to failure of activation of the contractile system. 5. Muscle fibres were quickly frozen for electron microscopical examination after shortening below slack length (to approximately 1.6 microns sarcomere spacing) during tetanic stimulation. In non‐fatigued fibres, and in fibres fatigued according to protocol 1, the myofibrils exhibited a straight appearance throughout the preparation suggesting that the entire volume of the fibre was properly activated. In fibres fatigued by protocol 2, on the other hand, only the most peripheral layers of myofibrils remained straight after shortening, whereas the centre of the fibre showed marked waviness indicating failure of the inward spread of activation in this case.},

	abstract = {Muscle performance declines during prolonged and intense activity; important components are a reduction in force production and shortening velocity and a prolongation of relaxation. In this review we consider how the changes in metabolites (particularly H+, inorganic phosphate (Pi), ATP and ADP) and changes in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release lead to the observed changes in force, shortening velocity and relaxation. The reduced force is caused by a combination of reduced maximum force‐generating capacity, reduced myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity and reduced Ca2+ release. The reduced maximum force and Ca2+ sensitivity are largely explained by the effects of H+ and Pi that have been observed in skinned fibres. At least three different forms of reduced Ca2+ release can be recognized but the mechanisms involved are incompletely understood. The reduced shortening velocity can be partly explained by the effects of H+ that have been observed in skinned fibres. In addition it is proposed that ADP, which depresses shortening velocity, increases during contractions to a level that is considerably higher than existing measurements suggest. Changes in Ca2+ release are probably unimportant for the reduced shortening velocity. The prolongation of relaxation can arise both from slowing of the rate of decline of myoplasmic calcium concentration and from slowing of cross‐bridge detachment rates. A method of analysis which separates these components is described. The increase in H+ and the other metabolite changes during fatigue can independently affect both components. Finally we show that reduced force, shortening velocity and slowed relaxation all contribute to the decline in muscle performance during a working cycle in which the muscle first shortens actively and then is stretched passively by an antagonist muscle.},
